DISCO:

Q/C/C:
q0: How many tries did it take to "get it right?"
To get a working project, it only really took two attempts. It looks significantly
greater due to the amount of times we interrupted copilot in the middle of generating
content. It wasn't very good looking, but it did retain all the necessary functions
of project 0 as far as a blog goes. Making it look nicer took another try, and having
it match the file structure displayed on the notes-and-code repo also took another.

q1: Did you catch any errors? If so, how did you notice, and what did you do?
One error was it attempting to use SQLalchemy after we told it not to. We terminated
the output before it could get anywhere. There was another thing with werkzeug being
the wrong version and not being provided in the requirements.txt we asked for. We
copy pasted the error generated by having the wrong package into copilot to get a solution.


q2: How similar or different is the bot's output to that of your past self / old team?
Well, Tanzeem's group did a storytelling site which only had about half the functionality.
Ben's group did a blog, which we weren't able to check because it seems like there were
some modifications made to the project after presentations that made it unable to run.
But compared to old blog projects I remember viewing, it had effectively the same functionality.
The only real difference is that the styling is really bad.
