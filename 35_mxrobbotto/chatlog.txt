Basic Flask app setup instructions
Build a basic flask app.

Sure, I'll create a basic Flask app for you. Below are the files you will need:

    app.py - The main application file.
    templates/index.html - A simple HTML template.

Let's start by creating the app.py file.

Next, let's create the index.html file inside the templates directory.

To run the app, navigate to the directory containing app.py and run the following command:
sh

python app.py

Your Flask app will be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
Create a web blog hosting site with the following qualities:

    Users will have to register to use the site.
    A logged-in user will be able to
        Create a new blog
        Update their blog by adding a new entry
        View and edit their own past entries
        View the blogs of other users

To create a web blog hosting site with the specified features, we'll need to build a Flask application with user authentication, blog creation, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for blog entries. Here is a basic structure of the application:

    app.py - The main application file.
    models.py - The file defining database models.
    forms.py - The file defining forms for user registration, login, and blog management.
    templates/ - Directory

To build a web blog hosting site with user registration, authentication, and CRUD functionalities, we will break this down into several steps:

    Setup and Configuration: Create and set up the Flask application.
    User Authentication: Implement user registration and login functionality.
    Blog Management: Allow users to create, update, and delete blogs and entries.
    Viewing Blogs: Allow users to view their own and others' blogs.

We'll use Flask extensions such as Flask-SQLAlchemy for database management, Flask-WTF for form handling, and Flask-Login for user session management.
Step 1: Setup and Configuration

Do not use SQLalchemy

Sure, we can build the Flask web blog hosting site without using SQLAlchemy. Instead, we will use SQLite directly with the sqlite3 module. Here's how we can proceed:

Step 3: Running the Application

    Ensure you have Flask installed:

sh

pip install flask

    Run the Flask application:

sh

python app.py

This setup provides a basic blog hosting site with user registration, login, and CRUD operations for blogs using SQLite without SQLAlchemy.
Create a requirements.txt file that I can use pip install -r requirements.txt from

Sure! Here is the requirements.txt file for the Flask application:

You can use this file to install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
sh

pip install -r requirements.txt

ImportError: cannot import name 'url_quote' from 'werkzeug.urls' (/home/students/odd/2025/thasan50/Documents/proj/foo/lib/python3.10/site-packages/werkzeug/urls.py)

The error you're encountering is due to an incompatibility between Flask and the version of Werkzeug you have installed. Specifically, the url_quote function has been removed or moved in newer versions of Werkzeug.

To resolve this issue, you can either downgrade Werkzeug to a version that is compatible with your Flask version or upgrade Flask to a version that is compatible with your current Werkzeug version.
Option 1: Downgrade Werkzeug

Add a specific version of Werkzeug that is compatible with your Flask version to your requirements.txt file. For example:

Then run:
sh

pip install -r requirements.txt

Option 2: Upgrade Flask

Upgrade Flask to a version that is compatible with the latest Werkzeug. For example, you can upgrade Flask to the latest version:

Then run:
sh

pip install -r requirements.txt

Additional Step: Update Your Code if Needed

If you choose to upgrade Flask and Werkzeug, ensure that your code does not use any deprecated or removed functions. Update your imports and function calls as necessary.
Verifying the Changes

After making the changes to your requirements.txt file and installing the dependencies, try running your Flask application again:
sh

python app.py

This should resolve the import error you encountered.
If login fails, write an error message on the website. When registering, require that usernames already used do not repeat. Also, add some css styling and javascript to make the website look less basic.

Sure! Let's enhance the application with the requested features:

    Add error messages for failed login attempts.
    Ensure unique usernames during registration.
    Add CSS styling and JavaScript for a better user interface.

This setup provides a web blog hosting site with user registration, login, and CRUD operations for blogs, better error handling, and basic CSS and JavaScript for a nicer user interface.

Sure! Let's move the app.py and associated files into a folder called app and rename app.py to __init__.py. Here is the updated directory structure and the modified files:

Step 3: Create requirements.txt
Step 4: Run the Application

    Ensure you have Flask installed:

sh

pip install -r requirements.txt

    Run the Flask application:

sh

python -m app

This setup organizes the Flask application into an app folder with an __init__.py file, and includes templates, static files, and the necessary configurations.

Now make it so that blog titles cannot be repeated. Only show the files that are changed, and do not change more files than necessary.

Sure! We'll update the application to ensure that blog titles are unique. This requires changes in the __init__.py file to handle the uniqueness constraint for blog titles.
