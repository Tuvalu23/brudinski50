- I discovered how to use Jinja2 templating to  render content based on variables passed from Flask.

## QCC
- How can we make theimages more responsive to different screen sizes and add different + more complex styles to them?

## Instructions

1. **API Key**: Ensure you have your NASA API key saved in `key_nasa.txt`. This file should contain only the API key and should not be tracked by git.

2. **Install Flask**: Make sure Flask is installed in your Python environment.

   ```bash
   pip install flask
