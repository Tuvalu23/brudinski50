K27 - Basic functions in JavaScript
2025-01-06m

DISCO:
- Recursive functions in Scheme and JavaScript are the same structure-wise.
- Maybe we could add diagnostic print statements to add further clarity.
- Scheme uses `cond` for conditionals, while JavaScript uses `if-else`.

QCC:
- How efficient is the recursive fibonacci function for large inputs? It seems very slow.
- How about the factorial function?? (this reminds be of big O notation)

Notes:
- ALWAYS ENSURE the developer console is open to run JS test calls.
- You can copy and paste the test calls directly into the console if you want more verification.
