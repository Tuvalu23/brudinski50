NOTES:
- The Flask app now supports session management using Flask's built-in session mechanism.
- Users remain logged in via sessions until they manually log out by clicking the "Logout" link.
- The session data (username) is stored on the server and tracked using a cookie in the browser.
- Added diagnostic print statements for debugging purposes when users log in and log out.
- Cookies handled by flask's session by default.
