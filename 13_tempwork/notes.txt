# K13: CSV file parsing, flask, displaying to HTML as a table with links 
# 2024-10-1
# Time Spent : 1.5 Hours 

## 1. Project Setup
- flask is used to create a simple web application that serves an HTML page.
- occupation data is stored in a CSV file, which includes job classes, their percentage distribution, and helpful links for each occupation.
- the app uses a Python dictionary to map each job to its percentage and link.
- we used the template (`tablified.html`) to separate the Python and HTML code for efficiency.

## 2. Code Decisions
- the function `readfile()` was written to parse the CSV file into a dictionary where each job class is linked to both its percentage and the helpful resource URL.
- the `sel()` function selects a random occupation based on weighted percentages using the `random.choices()` method.
- in the `/wdywtbwygp` route, we pass the dictionary and the randomly selected job to the template, which is then used to generate the HTML page.

## 3. Template Structure
- the template (`tablified.html`) was designed to include:
  - a title.
  - a heading that includes the TNPG+roster.
  - a randomly selected job with a link to explore the job.
  - a table displaying all occupations, their percentages, and links.
  
## 4. egoless Programming Section
- clean and collaborative code development.
- reused and improved existing code for CSV parsing instead of starting from scratch.
- maintained open communication within the team to discuss our coding styles and preferences.
- docused on creating reusable, modular code that everyone on the team (even endrit) could understand and contribute to.

# EGO Section:
- we found it important to work as a team, recognizing that individual coding styles might differ, but the goal was to produce the cleanest, most understandable code.
- we discussed egoless programming principles and ensured everyone had a chance to contribute.
- each team member provided feedback to refine the code, and we reused elements where possible to save time.
