Plan to create domain:
* Download Nginx and ensure correct firewall privilages (for HTTP)
* Create foistapp located in /var/www/foistapp/
* Configure foistapp located in /etc/nginx/sites-avaliable/foistapp
* create a symlink between configuration and /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
* restart nginx using: sudo systemctl restart nginx

Domain Plan:
- We will NOT provision domain names.
- We'll use IP addresses for all deployments.

Deployment Steps (applied to each droplet):
1. SSH into the droplet
2. Install Python, pip, venv, and nginx
3. Set up Flask app (`myfoistapp`)
4. Test Flask with `python app.py`
5. Set up Nginx as reverse proxy
6. Restart Nginx and confirm the site loads
7. Repeat for each team member
8. Revisit each droplet and enable HTTPS with Certbot
