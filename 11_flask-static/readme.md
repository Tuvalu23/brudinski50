## K11: Some Things Never Change
### Due: 2024-09-26r before class

Your Trio Mission:

1. In a new directory in your workshop, save a copy of the demo for using flask to serve static files.
1. As a team...
  - Familiarize yourself with the app directory structure and the files' content.
  - Note anything notable.
  - Predict expected behaviors.
  - Spin up your website on localhost and reconcile behavior with prediction.
  - Record your notes in `readme` in app's root directory.
1. Once your team has done this, compose and store another html file named `fixie.html` (containing some html to render your team name and roster) so that flask can serve it staticly.
