# K22: Testing On-Ramps + Other FEFs

## DISCO
- Foundation's grid system and responsive classes make it easy to create layouts for multiple screen sizes.
- Learned how to use Foundation's `grid-x`, `grid-margin-x`, and `small-up`/`medium-up` classes to structure content dynamically.
- Developed a better understanding of HTML5 semantic elements (like `header`, `footer`, etc.).

## QCC
1. How do you balance custom CSS with prebuilt Foundation classes?
2. When should you use Foundation features over custom solutions for responsiveness?

## q0b
- [Foundation Documentation](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/)
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/)
- Consulted Nafiyu Murtaza for collaborative Topher-coding solutions.

## q1
At this stage, I prefer using Foundation because it simplifies responsive design and provides consistent styling without the need to reinvent the wheel. I like its predefined classes because they speed up development compared to custom frameworks.

## TW Version

## DISCO
- Tailwind allows you to use CSS inside HTML files, which really helps cutting down on the overall amount of code I have to code.
- I learned how to use Tailwind's grid and flex utilities for responsive design.
- I explored Tailwind's `shadow-lg`, `rounded-lg`, and `text-` classes for clean, modern UI styling.

# QCC
1. How do you balance utility classes with reusable components in Tailwind?
2. When is it better to use Tailwind's prebuilt classes versus writing custom CSS?
