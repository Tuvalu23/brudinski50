        <h2> How are the various Topher's in NYC currently doing?</h2>
        <!-- paragraff -->
        <p> In New York City there are various Topher's who are currently frolicking and having an overall great time. 
         The Topher's have been busy exploring the local pond, enjoying the crisp air of fall. They've been seen splashing
            around and socializing with other Michael's and Endrit's. Their playful antics bring joy to everyone who passes by.
